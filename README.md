Blockchain layers ; 0, 1,2,3

Layers help us understand and categorize the architecture of a blockchain.

#Layer 0#

Layer 0 is a root layer that allows blockchains to exchange data with each other. Polkadot is a layer 0.

#Layer 1#

Layer 1 is a foundational layer that is responsible for processing and validating transactions on its network. Bitcoin and Ethereum are layer 1.

#Layer 2#

Layer 2 solutions aim to speed up layer 1 by packaging up a bunch of transactions and sending them as one. This reduces time per transaction and transaction fees. Popular layer 2 tokens are Polygon and Loopring.

#Layer 3#

Layer 3 is the application layer that serves as the user interface. These decentralized applications can be anything from play to earn games to DeFi apps. Layer 3 cryptos are UniSwap or Decentraland.
